InControl-Scripts
=================

This repository holds scripts and samples of scripts that can be executed inside InControl Home Automation

### Script Creation

To create a script, you simply need a text editor. Load up your favorite one (Notepad++ works great). 
Create a new file in your Scripts folder -- normally located at 
`C:\Program Files (X86)\Moonlit Software, LLC\InControl HA\Scripts`. Name the file with a .CS extension.
